> An Ezrah react native take home.

## Quick Note.
Thanks for attempting our take home. This is a very simple one. It focuses on your choices and decisions in designing and creating beautiful UIs.


## React Native Base.

### Requirements Doc / Instructions
This test has 3 major UI components. The base of the project has already been created, setting up the base for you to make it your own unique view and solution. 
The UI flow.
- Tokens View.
- Single Token View
- Settings View.

The base structure of the Tokens View has been implement, Make the design yours (Recreate, Modify or Switch it up how ever you like)

**Implement the following core featureset.**

- Users can view tokens on the list and favourite a token.
- Users can Use their settings page to view a sample profile (nothing too serious) and view all the tokens they have favourited. In this page they can see the ones they've favourited and chosen to keep tabs on.
- Users can view a single token view when they click on the Tokens within the Tokens page. They would be able to see major details of the token.

**Refinement Ideas**
> You can implement what every your interface / design concepts are within the Settings view and the Single token page, but here are some Ideas
- Use a different font / product theme.
- Chart and Graphs (Single Token Page)
- etc. (Can't give out too much ideas ðŸ˜‰,, Let's see what you come up with.)

### APIs and Resources.
The API integrated within the project and setup with example .env are credentials for a free plan of [https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/](https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/) You can create a free account and implement based on it.
> Feel free to implement any other API end points within the API docs that could help you archieve your objectives.

## Node JS Base
Let's get a feel of your NodeJS skills. The Tasks is simple. Wrap the API in a graphql endpoint, With a properly defined query structure. Implement an LFU based Caching system for the data. 

## Conclusion.
Good luck.
